# PARAMETERS:
# Path = a single location, or a list of locations, where a location is a string, dict, list, or tuple â€“ The path to be snapped.
# Interpolate =  Whether to interpolate a path to include all points forming the full road-geometry.
#                When true, additional interpolated points will also be returned, resulting in a path 
#                that smoothly follows the geometry of the road, even around corners and through tunnels. 
#                Interpolated paths may contain more points than the original path.
